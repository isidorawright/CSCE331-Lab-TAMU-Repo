                I have recently joined the <a href="http://www.aggiecodingclub.com/">Aggie Coding Club</a>.
                I have been in the Cybersecurity Club for one year. Inside, I have completed a cybersecurity
                course, which went over basics such as IDOR, SQL, Cross-site scripting, using 
                <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/web-security-testing-with-burp-suite">Burp</a> 
                (a software that helps with security testing), using VWware (kali linux), etc.

            <h3>Interests in Computer Science and Cybersecurity</h3>

            <h4>Computer Engineering:</h4>

            <p class="border">
                My major is Computer Engineering; a combination of both computer hardware and software.
                I find both the hardware and software aspects of computers to be very fascinating.

                The reason I chose this major is because of two reasons:

                <ol class="border">
                    <li>
                        My father was an Electrical Engineer. Therefore, I grew up doing various projects
                        with him around the house (both electrical and non-electrical related). But I knew
                        that I wanted to work with more than just the hardware of computers and other appliances.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I took an AP coding course in high school and instantly fell in love with coding.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p class="border">
                I put those two together and I found computer engineering.
            </p>

            <p class="border">
                My technical interest in this field is to work in making the synchronization between the hardware
                and software of a computer system run faster and smoother. I find how the hardware and software of 
                an appliance communicate to each other to be able to run efficiently for users is very intriguing.
            </p>

            <h4>Cybersecurity:</h4>

            <p class="border">
                My technical interests in this field are: incident response, pentesting, designing systems, etc. 
                After having experience in non-technical assessments aspect of cybersecurity, I know that I want
                to work in the technical side of cybersecurity.
