            <h2>Feed The First Responders: </h2>
            <p>
                In my junior year of high school, I co-founded a community service project with my sisters called Feed the First Responders.
                We made homemade meals for three firestations in Plano and Allen, TX. We expanded our service project to our JROTC organization.
                We made sign-up sheets for those that wanted to participate each week, advertised the meal we would be making, and ensure they stayed
                clean through the duration of food prepping, making, and delivering. We expanded this project not only so that others could be a part of a 
                community service project they could put on their resume or give back to those that protect us. It was also to teach young people
                to be able to cook meals that they can make on their own. We saw that many children going to college did not know how to cook and 
                always spent money on fast food. Our goal in this service was to educate others on how simple making food is so that they could go 
                to college prepared, as well as, give back to our community. As part of this service, I lead a team of 3-5 people to safely and 
                cleanly make and deliver food for 30 - 40 firefighters.
