            <h2>Internship:</h2>
            <p>
                <h3>Summer 2022:</h3>
                This past summer, I did an internship with the DOE in Idaho Falls, Idaho through the <a href="https://orise.orau.gov/doe-omni/">
                OMNI</a> program. My project was to write a gap analysis between NIST 800-53 revision 4 and revision 5. For those that do not know, 
                <a href="https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework">NIST</a> is a cybersecurity framework that organizations and businesses can use to 
                help base their cybersecurity policies and procedures on. In 2020, NIST 800-53 revision 5 was released. My job was to see how rev 5 
                had been updated from rev 4, look at the DOE's policies and procedures, and write a report to tell them how their policies and 
                procedures should be updated in order to be up to date with NIST 800-53 revision 5. <br>

                Through my internship, I had the amazing opportunity to go to Sandia Labs in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to attend the TracerFire training.
                I was able to experience how to handle a real-time incident response situation. We were given a scenario and where taught how to use 
                the forensic tools needed to collect information from the footsteps of our adversaries. We then went into a 24-hour competition, where

            <h2>Codepath:</h2>
            <p>
                From August 2021 to May 2022, I took a cybersecurity course, outside of my Texas A&M courses, with a program called Codepath.
                To see a few assignments I worked on, there is the link for my CodePath GitHub Repository: 
                <a href="https://github.com/isidorawright/codepath_homework.git">CodePath Repository</a>. CodePath is not only for cybersecurity; 
                there are a variety of classes that you could take such as: web development, technical training, career center, mathworks, etc. 
                To learn more about CodePath classes, here is the link: <a href="https://www.codepath.org/">https://www.codepath.org/</a>.
