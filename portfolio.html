            This past summer, I did an internship with the DOE in Idaho Falls, Idaho. My project was to write a gap analysis between NIST 800-53
            revision 4 and revision 5. For those that do not know, <a href="">NIST</a> is a cybersecurity framework that organization and businesses can use to 
            help base their policies and procedures on.
