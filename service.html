            <p>
                I co-founded a community service project with my sisters called Feed the First Responders in highschool. We made homemade meals for 
                three firestations in Plano and Allen, TX. We expanded our service project to our JROTC organization. I lead a team of 3-5 people to
                safely and cleanly make and deliver food for 30 - 40 firefighters.
