                This is where I put my technical qualifications!!

            This past summer, I did an internship with the DOE in Idaho Falls, Idaho. My project was to write a gap analysis between NIST 800-53
            revision 4 and revision 5. For those that do not know, <a href="">NIST</a> is a cybersecurity framework that organization and businesses can use to 
            help base their policies and procedures on.

            <h2>Feed The First Responders: </h2>
            <p>
                I co-founded a community service project with my sisters called Feed the First Responders in highschool. We made homemade meals for 
                three firestations in Plano and Allen, TX. We expanded our service project to our JROTC organization. I lead a team of 3-5 people to
                safely and cleanly make and deliver food for 30 - 40 firefighters.
